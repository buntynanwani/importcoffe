## 🌍 The Story Behind Our Mission  

### 🚨 A Crisis in the Making  
Imagine it’s **3 AM** — your child has a high fever, but the nearest hospital is **45 minutes away** through congested streets.  
This is the **daily reality** for thousands of families living in rapidly expanding cities where infrastructure can’t keep up.

As cities grow:
- 🏘️ New neighborhoods emerge without nearby healthcare.
- 🏥 Central hospitals face overcrowding.
- 🌆 Urban sprawl increases pollution and energy demand.

## ❤️ The Healthcare Gap  

Access to healthcare within **15 minutes** can make the difference between life and death.  
Yet, many communities experience:

- ⏱️ **Delayed emergency responses** with fatal outcomes  
- 🩺 **Limited access to basic healthcare** services  
- 💰 **High travel costs** for medical treatment  
- 😟 **Reduced quality of life** and constant anxiety about emergencies

## 🌱 The Sustainable Solution  

Our platform doesn’t just plan hospitals — it builds **sustainable, self-powered communities**.  
Cities are responsible for:
- ⚡ Over **75% of global energy consumption**
- 🌫️ Around **60% of greenhouse gas emissions**

We combine **healthcare planning** with **renewable energy infrastructure** to:
- ☀️ Power hospitals with solar and wind energy  
- 🔋 Reduce dependency on fossil fuels  
- 🧠 Enable data-driven sustainable urban growth

## 🎯 Project Overview  

The **Smart City Planning Platform** is an interactive, web-based tool that helps:
- 🏗️ Urban planners  
- 🧭 Policymakers  
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Local communities  

…make **data-driven decisions** for healthier, greener cities.

It leverages **NASA Earth observation data** and **geospatial analysis** to visualize:
- 🏥 Healthcare infrastructure and underserved zones  
- 🌞 Renewable energy potential (solar & wind)  
- 📊 Sustainable urban development recommendations

## 💡 Why This Matters  

Each dot on our map represents:
- A **life that could be saved**  
- A **community that could thrive**  
- A **city that can grow responsibly**  

When healthcare is nearby and powered by clean energy, we’re not just designing cities —  
we’re designing **hope and resilience**.
