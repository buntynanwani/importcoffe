🏙️ Smart City Planning Platform
The Story Behind Our Mission
A Crisis in the Making
Imagine waking up at 3 AM to your child's sudden high fever. Panic sets in as you realize the nearest hospital is 45 minutes away through congested city streets. In rapidly growing urban areas, this nightmare scenario plays out daily for thousands of families.
As cities expand at unprecedented rates, essential infrastructure struggles to keep pace. Communities emerge in peripheral zones without adequate healthcare access. Meanwhile, city centers face overcrowded facilities, and the environmental cost of unsustainable growth threatens the very livability of our urban spaces.
The Healthcare Gap
Studies show that access to healthcare within 15 minutes can be the difference between life and death in emergencies. Yet in fast-growing cities, entire neighborhoods are being developed without considering this critical metric. Residents in these areas face:

Delayed emergency response times that can have fatal consequences
Preventable disease progression due to inaccessible routine care
Economic burden from traveling long distances for basic health services
Reduced quality of life and constant anxiety about medical emergencies

A Sustainable Solution
Our platform addresses this crisis while tackling another urgent challenge: climate change. Cities consume over 75% of global energy and produce 60% of greenhouse gas emissions. By integrating healthcare planning with renewable energy infrastructure, we create communities that are both healthy and sustainable.
🎯 Project Overview
The Smart City Planning Platform is an interactive web-based tool that empowers urban planners, policymakers, and communities to make data-driven decisions about city growth. Using NASA Earth observation data and geospatial analysis, our platform visualizes:

Healthcare Infrastructure: Current hospital locations and underserved areas needing new facilities
Renewable Energy Potential: Optimal zones for solar panels and wind turbines based on natural resources
Data-Driven Planning: Evidence-based recommendations for sustainable urban development

Why This Matters
Every dot on our map represents real lives that could be saved, real communities that could thrive, and real progress toward a sustainable future. When a family has a hospital nearby and their energy comes from clean sources, we're not just building a city—we're building hope.
